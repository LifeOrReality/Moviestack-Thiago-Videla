Hello!

We’ve reviewed your exercises and think we’ve found the perfect spot for you. Moviestack has contacted us to create and design a site for them, the idea is to develop the app from scratch. It’s a movie review site.

I’ll be including the wireframes for you to have a base on what the client wants. Feel free to choose your color palette, and make any design changes that will upgrade the app without losing content. I’ll also be including a sample of how the data is stored in its database. They asked us to include this data in the project to see a sample of it.

For this first sprint we’ll need the home page and the movies page, you'll need to use JavaScript to show dynamically the information sent to us.

Thanks,
Paula Davis
Team Leader at Web Code
